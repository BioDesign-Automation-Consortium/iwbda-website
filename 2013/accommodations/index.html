                <p>To book Imperial College campus accommodations, go to this link: <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/summeraccommodation">make booking link</a></p>

                <p>If you are attending both SB6.0 and IWBDA 2013, enter the code <strong>SB602013</strong> to display the reserved block of rooms set aside for the two conferences. Please note: this code is not for a discounted rate, but rather will refer to the reserved block of rooms set aside for the conferences. This is important for SB6.0 because July 8-11th are busy days in London and you may have difficulty booking for those nights if you do not use the code. </p>

                <p>If you are only attending IWBDA 2013, do not use the code when booking your room. Imperial College has plenty of rooms available from July 11-14th and no code is required to book for those dates.</p>
