<div><h4 id="toc_0">About IWBDA</h4>

<p>The <strong>Eighth International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA)</strong> will bring together researchers from the synthetic biology, systems biology, and design automation communities to discuss concepts, methodologies and software tools for the computational analysis and synthesis of biological systems.</p>

<p>The field of synthetic biology, still in its early stages, has largely been driven by experimental expertise, and much of its success can be attributed to the skill of the researchers in specific domains of biology. There has been a concerted effort to assemble repositories of standardized components; however, creating and integrating synthetic components remains an ad hoc process. Inspired by these challenges, the field has seen a proliferation of efforts to create computer-aided design tools addressing synthetic biology's specific design needs, many drawing on prior expertise from the electronic design automation (EDA) community.</p>

<p>The IWBDA offers a forum for cross-disciplinary discussion, with the aim of seeding and fostering collaboration between the biological and the design automation research communities.</p>

<p>IWBDA is organized by the non-profit <a href="http://www.bio-design-automation.org">Bio-Design Automation Consortium (BDAC)</a>. BDAC is an officially recognized 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design methodologies for synthetic biology.</li>
<li>Standardization of biological components.</li>
<li>Automated assembly techniques.</li>
<li>Computer-aided modeling and abstraction techniques.</li>
<li>Engineering methods inspired by biology.</li>
<li>Domain specific languages for synthetic biology.</li>
<li>Data exchange standards and models for synthetic biology.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Allan Kuchinsky IWBDA Scholarship</h5>
<p>
This year IWBDA will be soliciting applications for the 2nd annual
<a href="http://www.bio-design-automation.org/activities">Allan
Kuchinsky Internation Workshop on Bio-Design Automation
Scholarship</a>. Allan was a tremendous supporter of both synthetic
biology as well as design automation. His contributions to projects
such as Cytoscape and Eugene as well as numerous Agilent efforts was
crucial in helping academic and industrial researchers develop
state-of-the-art technologies and tools to lay the foundation for
this field. This scholarship in some small measure attempts to
recognize his tireless efforts by highlighting a student who shares
Allan's vision for the field.  This scholarship will provide support
for one recipient to attend IWBDA (registration, airfare, hotel, and
small travel stipend) along with a recognized poster presentation
slot. Interested individuals should provide the following:
IWBDA abstract, resume/CV, essay, and recommendation letter.
For details, including how to apply, please see <a href="docs/AKS_year2.pdf">this PDF</a>.
</p>

<p>The Allan Kuchinsky scholarship is generously sponsored by
Agilent.

<h5>Amoolya Singh</h5>
<img src="images/amoolya.png" alt="Amoolya Singh" style="float: left; padding: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" height="200px"/>
<p><strong>Dr. Amoolya Singh</strong> is a computational biologist and
Senior Scientist at Amyris.  She leads Amyris R&amp;D's Scientific
Computing group, whose work includes innovations in genotype
representation and data visualization, building mathematical and
statistical models to analyze high-throughput, multivariate genotype
and phenotype data; metabolic modeling and design-of-experiments to
perturb microbial biochemical pathways and identify bottlenecks
therein; and statistical process control to accelerate Amyris'
design-build-test-learn cycle.</p>

<p>Amoolya obtained a bachelor's degree with honors at Carnegie Mellon
double majoring in Biology and Computer Science; and a Ph.D. in
computational biology from UC Berkeley jointly advised by Adam Arkin
(Bioengineering) and Richard Karp (Math/CS).  Between degrees, she
worked as a software engineer at an Internet startup, a multinational
wireless telecommunications firm, and a Wall Street investment bank.
Prior to joining Amyris, Amoolya completed a postdoctoral fellowship
at the European Molecular Biology Lab in Heidelberg, Germany (with
Peer Bork) and a Computational &amp; Life Sciences fellowship at Emory
University (with Bruce Levin) in the fields of comparative genomics
and metagenomics, population genetics, and experimental evolution.</p>
<br /><br />

<h5>Natalio Krasnogor</h5>
<img src="images/natalio.png" alt="Natalio Krasnogor" style="float: left; padding: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" height="200px"/>
<p><strong>Prof. Natalio Krasnogor</strong> is Professor of Computing
Science and Synthetic Biology, co-directs Newcastle's
<a href="http://ico2s.org/">Interdisciplinary Computing and Complex
BioSystems (ICOS)</a> research group and is director of
the <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/csbb/">Centre for Synthetic Biology
and the Bioeconomy (CSBB)</a>. Prof. Krasnogor holds a prestigious EPSRC
Leadership Fellowship in Synthetic Biology, is the overall lead in the
EPSRC Synthetic Biology ROADBLOCK project involving Newcastle,
Nottingham, Sheffield, Warwick and Bradford Universities that seeks to
develop in silico and in vivo techniques for engineering biofilms. He
leads the &quot;Synthetic Portabolomics: Leading The Way at the
Crossroads of the Digital and Bio Economies&quot; EPSRC project.</p>

<p>With expertise in Synthetic
Biology, Complex Systems and Machine Intelligence, Prof. Krasnogor gave
several keynote talks (e.g., IEEE CEC, PPSN, GECCO); has &gt;170
publications (H-index 37), with many of his papers in the top 0.1% and
1% for number of citations in computing science and has published also
in top tier journals such as Nature Biotech, Nature Chemistry, and PNAs.
He won several best papers prizes as well as Bronze, Silver and
Gold awards of the American Computing Society's (ACM) HUMIES award for
human-competitive results that were produced by any form of genetic
and evolutionary computation and an ACM's Impact award.  From 2012 to
2014 he was the Science Director of the European Centre for Living
Technologies (Italy), was distinguished visiting professor at Ben
Gurion University (Israel) in 2009 and Weizmann Institute of Science
(Israel) in 2010, 2012, and 2013.</p>

<img src="images/CASTLE02.jpg" alt="Durham Castle" style="float: right; padding: 20px 20px 20px 20px;" height="200px"/>

<p>
Please join us for our Annual IWBDA Dinner taking place at Durham
Castle on Wednesday, August 17th! Transportation will be provided to
and from the event from the main IWBDA venue, the Centre for
Life. Attendees will be asked to register for the dinner when they
purchase their ticket for IWBDA.  Prior to dinner, we will enjoy a
guided tour of the 900-year
old <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/durham.castle/">Durham Castle</a>
and gain entry to <a href="http://www.durhamcathedral.co.uk/">Durham Cathedral</a>, both of which are part of the
<a href="http://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/">Durham World
Heritage Site</a>. After the tour of the castle is finished, attendees
will have the option of exploring Durham Cathedral prior to enjoying
dinner together.
</p>

<p>
Coaches will leave the Centre for Life at 3:40 PM and leave the dinner to return at 10:30 PM.
