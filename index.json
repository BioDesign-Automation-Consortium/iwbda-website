To do so, we have expanded our existing computational models for colloidal physics and biological processes in E. coli to build a physically- and biochemically-resolved, complete model of the JCVI-syn3.0a synthetic minimal cell, which we will use to probe the matter/life nexus. A cell comprising the minimal set of genes essential to life is an ideal proving ground for probing this matter/life nexus. This minimal system is encompassed in a well-known cell [1] with the simplest naturally occurring genome, Mycoplasma genitalium, and has been successfully isolated in a synthetic cell [2-4]. We believe there are life-essential physics that cooperate with these minimal genetics [5-8] — and some that bypass genetics [9] — to lead matter to life. Discovery and identification of the fundamental physics required to instantiate life in the simplest living cell would enlarge the picture of life currently framed by biochemistry and the Central Dogma. Our focus is on micro- scale physics that organize cytoplasm, communicate long-range dynamics, and help regulate combinatoric chemistry. This middle world [10] between structural and systems biology involves physical dynamics and spatial resolution outside current cell-modeling techniques. In non-living matter, mixtures of macromolecules in solvent are called colloids; or colloidal suspensions. To reveal how colloidal-scale physics instantiate life in the cell, we will build a model cell in silico, where conclusions drawn from the minimal set of genes, proteins, and other life-essential molecules implicate broad principles at the matter/life nexus. Three basic elements are required and will be achieved: a confining cavity; individual representation of physical shape, size, relative abundance, and crowding of biomolecules; and accurate, efficient representation of biochemical and physical interactions between biomolecules.\n[1] C.M.

In particular, the stochastic nature of transcription makes coordinating expression across multiple genetic elements difficult. Further, delivery of large genetic cargoes limits the efficiency of cellular engineering. Thus, our work is focused on the design of highly-compact genetic tools with a minimal genomic footprint. Simultaneously, we have been developing cocktails of transgenes that are capable of rapidly convert cells into neurons. The sparse and stochastic nature of reprogramming has obscured our understanding of how transcription factors drive cells to new identities. To overcome this limit, we developed a compact, portable reprogramming system that increases direct conversion of fibroblasts to motor neurons by two orders of magnitude. Low rates of direct conversion have previously limited the potential for central nervous system (CNS) applications. Using compact, optimized, polycistronic cassettes, we generate motor neurons that graft with the murine central nervous system, demonstrating the potential for in vivo therapies. With improved tools for identifying cell-fate regulators and tracking subpopulations, we are building genetic controllers that can regulate transgenic cargoes and cell fate in primary cells. Developing genetic control systems provides an essential foundation for realizing the promise of synthetic biology in translational therapies.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d0748d2dd2da42b90e0b7cbac340a118","permalink":"/authors/dr-katie-galloway/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/dr-katie-galloway/","section":"authors","summary":"Katie Galloway is the W.

In addition to the models, we develop an associated ecosystem of design and analysis tools, including the interactive design tool oxView. We give an overview of the latest additions to the oxDNA ecosystem and present our application of model-driven design of a single-stranded RNA origami nanostructure. mRNAs with highly structured ORFs have superior cold-chain stability and in vivo translation, but the boundary between compact folding and efficient ribosome access remains unclear. Single-stranded mRNA origami (mRNA-OG) is an intramolecular folding approach producing highly double-stranded nanoparticles and offers a route to extreme transcript compaction, but its feasibility hinges on whether cellular translation machinery can effectively access and unwind the transcript without activating cellular stress pathways. We show that our designed mRNA-OG nanoparticles adopt compact, planar architectures with exceptional robustness to variation in ionic strength and temperature. Despite their dense folding, these constructs remain translation-competent in both immortalized cell lines and primary cells. Compared with unstructured transcripts, mRNA-OGs display markedly improved stability during 4 C storage and show no activation of integrated dsRNA-sensing pathways, as assessed by polysome profiling and EIF2A phosphorylation assays.

Great strides have been made, but a general challenge is most molecular programming paradigms are developed to operate in a narrow set of environments or applications. Further, sensing, information processing, and signal transduction are often coupled within a single device or design, making interoperability difficult. In contrast, in electronic computing inputs are converted into a universal machine language for information processing, and outputs of the machine instructions are mapped back to an application specific response. This enables seamless communication and integration across devices and applications. To enable similarly broad programmability of biological systems, we are developing a molecular equivalent of these machine instructions based on genetically encoded RNA strand exchange circuits called ctRSD circuits. RNA strand exchange reactions are easily programmed via predictable base pairing interactions universal across cell types, enabling wide operability. Further, in vitro nucleic acid strand exchange reactions are one of the most scalable and programmable biomolecular systems to date, demonstrating, for example, neural network-based classification of hundreds of inputs. Towards the goal of a general-purpose molecular programming language, we have demonstrated ctRSD circuits operate predictably in in vitro transcription reactions, cell-free transcription and translation systems, and bacterial cells. To seamlessly convert from different chemical spaces into RNA strand exchange space for information processing, we are developing biosensors that transduce nucleic acid, metabolite, ion, and protein binding into RNA expression. Lastly, we are developing mechanisms to map out of RNA space to target different applications, so far demonstrating RNA strand exchange to precisely control protein expression. These results begin to demonstrate how general-purpose RNA strand exchange circuits can be used as a CPU for synthetic biology.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7a2304f1b07e86a5a8b21932502e6221","permalink":"/authors/dr-samuel-schaffter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/dr-samuel-schaffter/","section":"authors","summary":"Sam Schaffter has been a chemical engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 2020.
