<div><h4 id="toc_0">About IWBDA</h4>

<p>The <strong>Eleventh International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation
(IWBDA)</strong> will bring together researchers from the synthetic
biology, systems biology, and design automation communities to discuss
concepts, methodologies and software tools for the computational
analysis and synthesis of biological systems.</p>

<p>The field of synthetic biology, still in its early stages, has
largely been driven by experimental expertise, and much of its success
can be attributed to the skill of the researchers in specific domains
of biology. There has been a concerted effort to assemble repositories
of standardized components; however, creating and integrating
synthetic components remains an ad hoc process. Inspired by these
challenges, the field has seen a proliferation of efforts to create
computer-aided design tools addressing synthetic biology's specific
design needs, many drawing on prior expertise from the electronic
design automation (EDA) community.</p>

<p>The IWBDA offers a forum for cross-disciplinary discussion, with
the aim of seeding and fostering collaboration between the biological
and the design automation research communities.</p>

<p>IWBDA is organized by the
non-profit <a href="http://www.bio-design-automation.org">Bio-Design
Automation Consortium (BDAC)</a>. BDAC is an officially recognized
501(c)(3) tax exempt organization.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design methodologies for synthetic biology.</li>
<li>Standardization of biological components.</li>
<li>Automated assembly techniques.</li>
<li>Computer-aided modeling and abstraction techniques.</li>
<li>Engineering methods inspired by biology.</li>
<li>Domain specific languages for synthetic biology.</li>
<li>Data exchange standards and models for synthetic biology.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Allan Kuchinsky IWBDA Scholarship</h5>
<p>
This year IWBDA will be soliciting applications for the 5th annual
<a href="http://www.bio-design-automation.org/activities">Allan
Kuchinsky Internation Workshop on Bio-Design Automation
Scholarship</a>. Allan was a tremendous supporter of both synthetic
biology as well as design automation. His contributions to projects
such as Cytoscape and Eugene as well as numerous Agilent efforts was
crucial in helping academic and industrial researchers develop
state-of-the-art technologies and tools to lay the foundation for
this field. This scholarship in some small measure attempts to
recognize his tireless efforts by highlighting a student who shares
Allan's vision for the field.  This scholarship will provide support
for one recipient to attend IWBDA (registration, airfare, hotel, and
small travel stipend) along with a recognized poster presentation
slot. Interested individuals should provide the following:
IWBDA abstract, resume/CV, essay, and recommendation letter.
For details, including how to apply, please see <a href="docs/AKS_year5.pdf">this PDF</a>. 

<p>The Allan Kuchinsky scholarship is generously sponsored by Agilent.

<h4>Anti-harassment Policy</h4>

<p>
The International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation will not tolerate
harassment of workshop participants. Examples of such prohibited
practices would include gossiping, slurs, offensive or derogatory
comments, or other verbal or physical conduct. This includes sexual
harassment as defined as "unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature" not only when the conduct is made as a condition of workshop
participation ("quid pro quo" harassment), but when the conduct
creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive workshop
environment. IWBDA participants who feel they are being harassed by
participants, organizers, or support staff should make it clear to the
individual(s) that such behavior is offensive and unwelcome. Any
participant who believes he or she has been subjected to harassing
conduct can report the matter to the IWBDA organizing committee or the
Bio-Design Automation Consortium (BDAC) executive committee.
