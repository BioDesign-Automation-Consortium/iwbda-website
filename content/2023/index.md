      title: Submission Guidelines
      text: |-
        Abstracts and workshop proposals must be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iwbda23). Submissions cannot exceed two pages (excluding figures and tables). If you do not have an EasyChair account, please create one by following the instructions specified [here](https://easychair.org/help/account_creation).

        All abstracts must use the IWBDA template and must not exceed two pages excluding the figures and tables. The following versions of the template are available for use: 
          - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wbdpqqpstxbg)
          - {{<staticref "uploads/IWBDA_2023_Abstract_Template.zip" "newtab">}}LaTeX source{{</staticref>}}
          - {{<staticref "uploads/IWBDA_2023_Abstract_Template.docx" "newtab">}}MS Word{{</staticref>}}
         
        All abstracts will undergo a single-blind peer review process on EasyChair. The accepted abstracts will be invited to present their work as a poster or a talk at the conference.

        We encourage abstracts for posters and/or talks at IWBDA 2023 on ongoing research that may be submitted as a full journal paper later. We are currently in talks with [ACS Synthetic Biology](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/asbcd6) to set up a special issue on bio-design automation for such extended journal submissions.
