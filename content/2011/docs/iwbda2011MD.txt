The '''Third International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA)''' at DAC will bring together researchers from the synthetic biology, systems biology, and design automation communities. The focus is on concepts, methodologies and software tools for the computational analysis of biological systems and the synthesis of biological systems.

Still in its early stages, the field of synthetic biology has been driven by experimental expertise; much of its success can be attributed to the skill of the researchers in specific domains of biology. There has been a concerted effort to assemble repositories of standardized components. However, creating and integrating synthetic components remains an ad hoc process. The field has now reached a stage where it calls for computer-aided design tools. The electronic design automation (EDA) community has unique expertise to contribute to this endeavor. This workshop offers a forum for cross-disciplinary discussion, with the aim of seeding collaboration between the research communities.

Topics of interest include:

*Design methodologies for synthetic biology.
*Standardization of biological components.
*Automated assembly techniques.
*Computer-aided modeling and abstraction techniques.
*Engineering methods inspired by biology. 
*Domain specific languages for synthetic biology.
*Data exchange standards and models for synthetic biology.
