    <h5>Reality-Based Interaction for Bio- Design</h5>
    <p>Synthetic biology requires a multidisciplinary, collaborative design environment in order to engineer the complex biological systems of the future.  Applying advances in Human Computer Interaction to bio-design tools could potentially enhance innovation and discovery in synthetic biology.</p>
    <p>Over the past two decades, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research has generated a broad range of interaction styles that move beyond the desktop into new physical and social contexts. Key areas of innovation in this respect include tabletop, tangible, and embodied user interfaces. These interaction styles leverage users' existing knowledge and skills of interaction with the real non-digital world, thus are often referred to as <em>Reality-Based</em> Interfaces. By drawing upon existing skills, reality-based interfaces offer the promise of a natural, intuitive, and often, collaborative form of interaction.</p>
	<p>In this talk I will present a collection of software tools for bio design, which, utilize reality-based interaction techniques.  We developed theses software tools to address specific technical synthetic biology challenges while simultaneously advancing the way in which users interact with computing environments. Through these case studies, I will highlight what design factors are important for developing reality-based interfaces for bio design that enhance discovery and innovation.</p>

	<p><strong>Dr. Orit Schaer</strong> is the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Media Arts and Sciences at Wellesley College. She directs the Wellesley College HCI Lab. Her research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on 3D, tangible, tabletop, and mobile interaction. a user interface for genomic research, and the development of computational tools for enhancing innovation in bio-design. Dr Shaer is a recipient of several National Science Foundation and industry awards including the prestigious NSF CAREER Award, Agilent Technologies Research Award, and Google App Engine Education Award. She received her PhD and MSc in Computer Science from Tufts University. She has been a research fellow in the Design Machine Group at the University of Washington and in the University College London Interaction Center.</p>

    <h4>Tuval Ben-Yehezkel</h4>
    <p>Our ability to engineer biological systems depends, to a large extent, on our ability to physically write the DNA code that programs them. In this talk I will outline recent developments in biochemistry and automation technologies that advance our ability to deliver designer DNA libraries for advanced synthetic biology projects.</p>

    <p><strong>Dr. Tuval Ben-Yehezkel </strong>performed his PhD and post doc work at the Weizmann institute of science in Israel under the supervision of Prof. Ehud Shapiro in the field of synthetic biology. Specifically, he focused on developing methods for rapid writing of genetic material through the implementation of innovative biochemistry and automation technology and applying them to various biological problems. He is now a visiting scientist at the Weizmann institute of science and has recently founded a start-up company focused on applying synthetic biology technology for the rational design and construction of synthetic viruses aimed to function as live-attenuated vaccines.</p>
