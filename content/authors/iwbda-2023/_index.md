#  description: Abstracts and workshop proposals must be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iwbda23). Submissions cannot exceed two pages (excluding figures and tables). If you do not have an EasyChair account, please create one by following the instructions specified [here](https://easychair.org/help/account_creation). We encourage abstracts for posters and/or talks at IWBDA 2023 on ongoing research that may be submitted as a full journal paper later. We are currently in talks with ACS Synthetic Biology to set up a special issue on bio-design automation for such extended journal submissions.

<b>Now Open:</b> Submissions for our late breaking lightning talks for IWBDA!

Submit a short abstract between 100-200 words in length to be considered for our late breaking lightning talks. You may also include up to one figure, but it’s not a requirement.
Abstracts must be submitted through the [IWBDA EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iwbda23). Submissions cannot exceed 200 words (or 1 page if figure is included). 

If you do not have an EasyChair account, please create one by following the instructions specified [here](https://easychair.org/help/account_creation). Please check [Submission Guidelines](/2023/#submission-guidelines) for additional details including submission format.

Submissions are due by Wednesday, August 23.


# Call for Papers
Join us for the 15th annual IWBDA meeting, in Boston, September 11-14, 2023. This year, IWBDA will take place during [Bio Design Week](#biodesignweek) and will include presentation and poster talks selected from submitted abstracts, Birds of a Feather discussions, and breakout sessions on selected topics. We aim to bring together academic researchers and industry partners to push the field of bio-design automation for synthetic biology forward.

The field of biology is still lagging behind the industry when it comes to implementation and adoption of computational and digital solutions. This is primarily because it is extremely difficult to offer a one-size-fits-all solution to engineer biology. Some BDA solutions serve as templates for a larger problem, but, to make it usable in a practical setting, the solutions often have to be redesigned for bespoke biological workflows. Without understanding the requirements of the broader synthetic biology community, it is hard to design a solution that can have a wider impact. 

Increasing the efficiency of biological processes and workflows with biodesign automation is a continuous journey that requires fresh exchange of ideas. It is crucial for the BDA community to have a forum where they can collaborate, gather new perspectives, and understand the requirements of the broader synthetic biology community. IWBDA provides this forum for cross-disciplinary discussion, with the aim of seeding and fostering collaboration between the researchers from the synthetic biology, systems biology, and design automation communities.
