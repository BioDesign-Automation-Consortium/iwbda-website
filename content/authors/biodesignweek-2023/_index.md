Introducing **Bio Design Week**, a new annual event to bring people together to meet and discuss topics focused on the intersection of synthetic biology, systems biology, computer aided design, and lab automation. Bio Design Week will include the annual **International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA)**, additional meetings and workshops on relevant topics, social events, and a **Nona Works hackathon**.
Bio Design Week offers a forum for cross-disciplinary discussion, with the aim of seeding and fostering collaboration between the biological and the design automation research communities.


Bio Design Week and IWBDA are organized by the non-profit Bio-Design Automation Consortium (BDAC). The Nona Works Hackathon is organized by the Nona Foundation. BDAC and the Nona Foundation are both officially recognized 501(c)(3) tax exempt organizations.
