In 2019, Lukas Buecherl received his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Ulm, Germany. He continued his studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he completed both his Master's and Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering as part of the Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology Program. This program emphasized interdisciplinary studies, which laid the foundation for his current research interests at the intersection of engineering and biology.

Now, as an assistant professor in the Biological Engineering Department at Utah State University, Dr. Buecherl specializes in the analysis and improvement of genetic circuit design. His work leverages computational modeling and analysis techniques alongside experimental validation. Additionally, he explores the integration of electrical engineering and biology, focusing on laboratory automation and the development of microfluidic devices.

Dr. Buecherl is also an active member of the academic community, serving on the program committee for the International Workshop of Biodesign Automation. His contributions to the field have been recognized through several prestigious awards, including the Excellent Mentorship Award and the Outstanding Graduate Researcher Award from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Colorado Boulder.
