Call for Abstracts 

The 2nd International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation 
June 14 - 15, 2010
Part of the Design Automation Conference
Anaheim Convention Center 
Anaheim, California

The International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA) at DAC brings together researchers from the synthetic biology, systems biology, and design automation communities. The focus is on concepts, methodologies, and software tools to enable the computational analysis of biological systems and the synthesis of novel biological functions. 

Still in its early stages, the field of synthetic biology has been driven by experimental expertise; much of its success has been attributable to the skill of the researchers in specific domains of biology. There has been a concerted effort to assemble repositories of standardized components. However, creating and integrating synthetic components remains an ad hoc process. The field has now reached a stage where it calls for computer-aided design tools. The electronic design automation (EDA) community has unique expertise to contribute to this endeavor.  This workshop offers a forum for cross-disciplinary discussion, with the aim of seeding collaboration between the research communities. 

Topics of interest include:
- Design methodologies for synthetic biology. 
- Standardization of biological components.
- Automated assembly techniques.
- Computer-aided modeling and abstraction techniques. 
- Engineering methods inspired by biology.

The workshop will be held at the Anaheim Convention Center on June 14 - 15, 2010, as part of the Design Automation Conference, the premier conference in EDA with over 10,000 attendees. Registration information will be posted on the workshop webpage: http://www.biodesignautomation.org

Abstract Submission

Abstracts should be at least 500 words but not more than 1000 words in length; they may contain up to two figures; they should be in PDF form, up to 2 pages in length, with 1-inch margins and at least 10-point font size; they should indicate whether the submission is for a poster presentation, an oral presentation, or both; they should list the full names, affiliations and contact information of all authors.

Abstracts will be reviewed by the Program Committee. Those that are selected for oral and poster presentations will distributed to workshop participants and posted on the workshop website. 

Abstracts should be submitted by April 5th at: http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwbda10 (Abstracts submitted after April 5 will still be considered, until the presentation schedule is finalized, but may not receive full consideration.)

IWBDA Collection in PLoS ONE

New for 2010: Through a partnership with the Public Library of Science (PLoS), selected papers based on accepted abstracts will be published as a special collection of the interdisciplinary open access journal PLoS ONE (http://www.plosone.org). Authors of selected abstracts will be invited to submit a complete manuscript for publication in PLoS ONE. Submitted manuscripts will be reviewed according to PLoS ONE standard editorial policies http://www.plosone.org/static/authors.action
