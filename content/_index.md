      title: Submission Guidelines
      text: |-
        Abstracts must be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwbda24). Submissions cannot exceed two pages (excluding figures and tables). If you do not have an EasyChair account, please create one by following the instructions specified [here](https://easychair.org/help/account_creation). 
        
        All abstracts must use the IWBDA template and must not exceed two pages excluding the figures and tables. The following versions of the template are available for use:
        - [Overleaf]( https://www.overleaf.com/read/wbdpqqpstxbg#02d65f.)
        - {{<staticref "uploads/IWBDA_2023_Abstract_Template.docx" "newtab">}}MS Word{{</staticref>}}
        
        All abstracts will undergo a single-blind peer review process on EasyChair. The accepted abstracts will be invited to present their work as a poster or a talk at the conference.
        
        We encourage abstracts for posters and/or talks at IWBDA 2023 on ongoing research that may be submitted as a full journal paper later. We are currently in talks with ACS Synthetic Biology to set up a special issue on bio-design automation for such extended journal submissions.
