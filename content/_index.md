      text: |-
        Abstracts and workshop proposals must be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwbda25). Submissions cannot exceed two pages (excluding figures and tables). If you do not have an EasyChair account, please create one by following the instructions specified [here](https://easychair.org/help/account_creation). 
        
        We encourage abstracts for talks at IWBDA 2025 on ongoing research that may be submitted as a full journal paper later. We are currently in talks with ACS Synthetic Biology to set up a special issue on bio-design automation for such extended journal submissions.
