      title: Submission Guidelines
      text: |-

        Abstracts and workshop proposals must be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwbda25). Submissions cannot exceed two pages (excluding figures and tables). If you do not have an EasyChair account, please create one by following the instructions specified [here](https://easychair.org/help/account_creation).

         All abstracts must use the IWBDA template and must not exceed two pages excluding the figures and tables. The following versions of the template are available for use:
          - [Overleaf]( https://www.overleaf.com/read/wbdpqqpstxbg#02d65f.)
          - {{<staticref "uploads/IWBDA_2023_Abstract_Template.docx" "newtab">}}MS Word{{</staticref>}}

        All abstracts will undergo a single-blind peer review process on EasyChair. The accepted abstracts will be invited to present their work as a poster or a talk at the conference.

        We encourage abstracts for talks at IWBDA 2025 on ongoing research that may be submitted as a full journal paper later. We are currently in talks with ACS Synthetic Biology to set up a special issue on bio-design automation for such extended journal submissions.
